## Building the software

Use Gradle from the command line or a suitable IDE like JetBrains IDEA, Eclipse or NetBeans

From the command line, clean the build beforehandL

    > gradle clean 
    
Build the software from scratch:
    
    > gradle build
    
Run the unit tests

    > gradle test --info
    

Run the program with the default *"Sequence"* algorithm:

    > gradle run 
    
Run the program with the *"Colour"* algorithm:
    
    > gradle runColour 

Run the program with the *"Alternate"* algorithm:

    > gradle runAlternate



Bonus GUI aplication, run the JavaFX application with the following command:

    > gradle runGUI
    

NB: You might have to hard CONTROL-C to get the GUI to halt.
